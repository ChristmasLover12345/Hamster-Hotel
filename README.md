> Comments: Base desktop resolution looks good; Content within 'Reserve a Room' could use some padding/margin and the image could be fixed to stretch across the full container (try researching into the use of 'Cover' for Images and Background-Images); in 'Packages' section I would suggest having it set to col-6 to match the example better; in 'Amenities' find a way for the items to stay within the section as they shift when I'm changing the screen size; in 'Our Rooms' in either Tablet or Phone mode, there is a large gap from the top that causes the cards to overflow into the bottom section. So at that resolution, either resolve the gap, extend the background image, or even change the types of cards used at smaller resolutions; on the 'Running on the Wheel of Luxury' area, from 1798px and smaller, the box in no longer on the center of the screen, try to find a way to center it; While some of the smaller screen sizes could use some fixing, besides one or two things that need to be fixed, the desktop mode is passable;
